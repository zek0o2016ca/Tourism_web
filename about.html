                        <p>
                            Tutankhamun was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who ruled circa 1332â€“1323 BC during the late Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt.
                            Born Tutankhaten, he was likely a son of Akhenaten. Tutankhamun acceded to the throne around the age of nine following the short reigns of his predecessors Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten.
                            He married his half-sister Ankhesenpaaten, who was probably the mother of his two infant daughters.
                            Tutankhamun died unexpectedly aged about 18; his health and the cause of his death have been the subject of much debate.

                        <h2>Nefertiti</h2>
                        <p>
                            Nefertiti was a queen of the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the great royal wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten.
                            Nefertiti and her husband were known for their radical overhaul of state religious policy,
                            in which they promoted the earliest known form of monotheism,
                            Atenism, centered on the sun disc and its direct connection to the royal household
                            In the 20th century, Nefertiti was made famous by the discovery and display of her ancient bust, 
                            now in Berlin's Neues Museum. The bust is one of the most copied works of the art of ancient Egypt.

                        <p>
                            Ramesses III was the second Pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty in Ancient Egypt.
                            His long reign saw the decline of Egyptian political and economic power,
                            linked to a series of invasions and internal economic problems that also plagued pharaohs before him.
                            Rameses III constructed one of the largest mortuary temples of western Thebes, now called Medinet Habu.
                            He was assassinated in the Harem conspiracy led by his secondary wife Tiye and her eldest son Pentawere.
